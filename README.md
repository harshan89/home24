## Product Overview

This product has been strategically designed to efficiently manage a large-scale application, ensuring seamless scalability as the system expands. It remains highly resilient even in demanding production environments, allowing for rapid modifications to product types without compromising performance or stability.

## Frontend Architecture

Since we are not utilizing a micro frontend architecture, the frontend has been structured for scalability by isolating business logic within a dedicated business model layer. Meanwhile, the API layer, leveraging DTO models, ensures smooth communication with the backend. This separation keeps the service layer and Redux/Saga independent, promoting flexibility, maintainability, and resilience as the system grows in complexity.

### Class Structure (Business Models)

The class structure of this product module has been meticulously designed to uphold SOLID principles, ensuring a highly maintainable and scalable architecture.This approach enables seamless modifications, extensions, and enhancements without introducing unintended side effects to the broader system. The following diagram illustrates how a sample concrete class is implemented by extending an abstract class and implementing the relevant interface classes.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Login to the back office with email and password
- ‚úÖ See and navigate a product category tree
- ‚úÖ See a list of products belonging to a specific category in pages of 5, 10, 20, 50 elements per page
- ‚úÖ Sort product list by different fields (e.g., id, name) in ascending/descending order
- ‚úÖ View the product information on a separate product details page
- ‚ùå Add/modify attributes of a product. Possible attribute types: "number", "text", "url", "tags", "boolean"
- ‚úÖ See the last modified product in a custom widget on top of the page (custom here means that you have to implement a new component, not using the one that the component library of your choice provides)
- ‚úÖ Logout from the back office

#### Future To-Do

- Add tooltips (Enhance user experience with helpful tooltips across the interface.)
- Add more validations (Ensure data integrity and improve error handling.)
- Install a global notification system & handle notifications (Improve communication by managing notifications efficiently.)
- Move drawers and notifications to a custom hook for reusability (Enhance modularity and code reuse.)
- Refactor product details into separate components based on product types (Improve maintainability by structuring components per product type.)
- Implement UI-level functionality to fetch products based on category ID (The groundwork is done; focus on the user interface.)
